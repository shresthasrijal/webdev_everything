        <p class="author">By @fairless</p>
        <p class="text">For years, Sushan felt like they were hiding a part of themselves, trapped in sadness and fear
            of
            being judged. Every day felt heavy, and even small joys seemed out of reach. He did not want to be
            disowned as the only child!</p>
        <p class="text">But everything changed when Sushan decided to come out. The relief and happiness that followed
            were
            immediate, and the friends and family mostly showed love and support, and for the first time in a long
            time, Sushan felt free and truly themselves.</p>
