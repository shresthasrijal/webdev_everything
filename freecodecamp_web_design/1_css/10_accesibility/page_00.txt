1) What Are Some Tools to Check for Good Color Contrast on Sites?

    well,
    good color contrast is crucial for accessibility and readability.
    Several tools are available to help developers and designers check 
    and maintain appropriate color contrast ratios on their sites.

    i) Popular tools: WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker

    This allows u to input foreground and background colors of ur design 
    and instantly check if it meets WCAG standards.
    The website is very user-friendly and provides immediate feedback on
    whether ur color choices pass or fail the contrast requirements.

    to use it in their website, just add hexadecimal values of ur 
    foreground and background colors...

    ii) Another tool: TPGi Colour Contrast Analyzer

    Desktop app offers some advanced features. It allows to analyze 
    entire web pages, not just color pairs. U can use its color picker to 
    select colors directly from ur screen, making it easier to check 
    contrast ratios for existing designs.

    - The TPGi Colour Contrast Analyzer also provides simulations for 
    different types of color vision deficiencies, helping you ensure your 
    design is accessible to users with various forms of color blindness.
    - Once installed, you can use its eyedropper tool to select colors 
    from your screen and instantly see the contrast ratio.
    - This is particularly useful when working with complex designs or 
    checking contrast on live websites.

    iii) With these tools,
    you can create designs that are not only visually appealing but also 
    inclusive and accessible to a wider audience. This attention to 
    detail in color contrast can significantly improve the user 
    experience of your website for all visitors.

     They help ensure that your text is legible against its background, 
     which is essential for all users but particularly important for 
     those with visual impairments.
     
     while these tools are extremely helpful, they should be used in 
     conjunction with manual testing and user feedback. Different 
     contexts and user needs may require adjustments beyond what 
     automated tools can suggest.

2) What Are Best Practices for Hiding Content So It Doesn't Become 
Inaccessible?

    Hiding content in webdev should be done carefully to maintain 
    accessibility. Different CSS techniques affect whether assistive
    technologies can access hidden content.

    i) display: none
    eg:
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        <p class="hidden">Hidden text</p>
        <p>Visible text</p>

        .hidden {
            display: none;
        }

    This hides content visually and removes it from the accessibility 
    tree, so screen readers can not access it!

    ii) visibility: hidden
    eg:
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        <p class="hidden">Hidden text</p>
        <p>Visible text</p>

        .hidden {
            visibility: hidden;
            }

    The content stays in layout but is still inaccessible to assistive 
    technology.

    iii) Visually hidden but screen-reader-accessible 
    (.sr-only)

    eg:
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        <p class="sr-only">Hidden text</p>
        <p>Visible text</p>

        .sr-only {
            position: absolute;
            width: 1px;
            height: 1px;
            padding: 0;
            margin: -1px;
            overflow: hidden;
            clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
            white-space: nowrap;
            border: 0;
        }

    This hides content visually but keeps it in the accessibility tree, 
    useful for screen reader-only text.

    iv) HTML hidden attribute
    eg:
        <p hidden>This content is hidden</p>
        <p>This content is visible</p>

    Supported widely and hides from both sighted users and screen 
    readers, but can be toggled with JavaScript.

    Key reminder:
    Only hide content when it improves the user experience—important 
    information should remain visible and accessible to everyone.
