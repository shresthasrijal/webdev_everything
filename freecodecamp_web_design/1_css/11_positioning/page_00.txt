Understanding how to work with floats and positioning in css!

i) What are common use cases for using floats, how do they work?
    
    Floats in CSS was originally made to allow text to wrap around and element, like an image. But people found more ways to use it...
    In the past there didnt exist flexbox or grid so floats was used for the same effect. Still imp bc its a cool old party trick and working with legacy code.

    When an element is floated, it moves to the left or right of the container. THe content that follows wraps around the floated element, filling the remaining space. 
    One classic use is wrapping text around mages, where an image is on one side and the text wraps around it.

    eg:

        <div class="container">
        <img src="https://placehold.co/150x150" alt="Placeholder Image">
        </div>

        .container {
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 10px;
            }

        img {
            float: left;
            margin-right: 20px;
            }

    In this example, the container doesnt wrap around the floated image. THe image is out of normal document flow, and the container collapsed to height zero bc it didnt see the floated children elements.. but the image still shows up, out of the container which became inviisble due to 0 height.

    Also, floats were also popular for creating multi-column layouts before Flexbox and Grid became widespread. When u float elements next to eachother, developers could create columns that aligned horizontally. 

    But, when using floats, it imp to handle the problem collapsing paresnts elments when their child elemnts are floated.

    The clearfix solution for the div disappeared is done via clear fix on the class container in div.
    
    eg:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <div class="container">
    <img src="https://placehold.co/150x150" alt="Placeholder Image">
    <p> This is an example of text flowing around a floated image.</p>
    </div>


    .container {
    border: 1px solid black;
    }

    /* Clearfix CSS */
    .container::after {
        content: "";  
        display: block;
        clear: both;
    }

    img {
        float: left;
        margin-right: 20px;
    }


    - the fixes are basically:
        - ::after is a pseudo-element that adds an invisible block  
            after the content of the container.
        - content: "" ensures the pseudo-element is present but doesn’t 
            display any content.
        - display: block makes the pseudo-element a block-level element.
        - clear: both ensures the pseudo-element clears both sides of 
            any floated elements above it.

    
    In the above example of the fix, the collapse is made more noticible via the <p> element.  Bc the aragraph remains in the normal document flow, the container explands just enought to wrap arodnt it. Then we need to appy the clearfix technique to fix the collapse and make the container's border display correctly. Yo  can try tremvoing the clearfix reule to see the conairer collapse again. 

    While floats are no longer the go-to method for complex layouts due to more modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid, they still play an essential role in certain scenarios.
    Like text wrapping around images or reworking legacy projects.

ii) What is relative positioning, and how does this differ from default static positioning?

    In CSS positioning allows us to control how elements are laid out on a page. Two common types of positioning:
    
    - Static positioning 
    Defauly for all elements and does not need any special declaration CSS. U wont notice anything different when using static position bc it just keeps elements where they natuarally occur. 
    
    eg: 
    <p> right here man </p>

    - Relative positioning
    Allows an element to shifted from its normal position without disrupting the flow of the document. It is like moving the moment from its default static position by giving it new coordinates.

    eg:
    <p class="relative">This paragraph is positioned relatively.</p>

    body {
        border: solid 1px black;
        }

    .relative {
        position: relative;
        top: 30px;
        left: 30px;
        }


    In this example, the paragraph will appear 30px down and 30px right of where it is. Basially say element is moving 30px away from top of its original position making it 30px down.

iii) What Is Absolute Positioning, and How Does It Work?

    Absolute positioning allows an element to be removed from the normal document flow, letting it behave independently of other elements. It is useful for floating UI features like modals, tooltips, or dropdown menus. WHich could possibly overlap other content.

    By default, an absolute positioned element is placed relative to its closest positioned ancestor. IF no such ancestor exists, it positions relative yo the initial containing blocl, usually the browser viewport. U can control its placement with the top, bottom, left and right properties.

    Example: Setting top: 30px and left: 30px moves the element 30px away from the top and left edges of its containing block:

    p {
        position: absolute;
        top: 10px;
        left: 10px;
        }

    remove the element and place it freely on top.
