<!-- Understanding HTML Attributes and HTML Boilerplate -->

<!-- Role of html in web? -->
<!-- 
    its a markup lang to create webpages, any webpage with paragraphs, links, videos
    that all is html.
    - HTML is the content and structure of a webpage via use of elements
    eg: <p> Hello </p>
    - most elements have an open/start and close/end tabs, and the content between them
    
    - Some dont have a close tag, and they are void elements
    eg: <img> ---- a void element (they cant have any content)
    but if nothing how to show image, then u have to add some attributes to the tag
    
    eg: <img src="image path"/>
    img == tag, src = attribute name, "" = attribute value
    
    eg: <img src="example_cat_img_url" alt= "Cat sleeping in the grass">
    - alt attribute here is used to provide short descriptive text for the images

    is html itself not enough to create website?
    > depends if ur creating a small webpage with only text and images, then yes

    if u want a modern website then u need html, css, js
        html -> content/structure
        css -> styling
        js -> interacitivity
    
    html = foundation and frame
    css = interior and exterior design - make pretty
    js = electricial and water system, so the house is usable    
-->

<!-- What are attributes how do they work? -->
 <!-- 
    attribute is a value placed in the opening tag of an html element
    - they either provide additional info or how the element should behave

    eg: <div id='root'></div> 
    id is the attribute here

    eg: hyperlink
    <a href="ur_url.com">some description of url or text</a>

    eg: <img src="example_cat_img_url" alt= "Cat sleeping in the grass">
    - "alt" attribute here is used to provide short descriptive text for the images
    - here alt is not necessary, but its recommeneded for accessibility purposes,
    it can help some one understand the image for example

    some attributes are a little more unique like the checkbox input's checked
    eg: <input type="checkbox" checked />
    the "checked" attribute is used to specify the checkbox is always checked by default
 
    html has loads of elements and loads of attributes that can alter the behavior or
    appearance of elements on a webpage

<!-- What Is the Role of the Link Element in HTML,
      and How Can It Be Used to Link to External Stylesheets? -->
<!-- 
    The link element is used to link to external resources like stylesheets 
    and site icons. 
    These link elements help define the relationship between linked resource
    and the html document 
    - u add it inside the head element.

    eg: <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" /> -- basic syntax
    -- if html is in a sub fodler, from css location u do "../style.css"
    
    - ./ means to look into the current file directory
    "note: it is best practice to have ur css and html in seperate files 
    but u can have them in the same file too just saying"

    - use cases would be text styles(fonts) or icons to use freely,
    it can help save resources loading them into html
    eg: <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico"/> 
    -- here "rel" attribute specifies the relationship between the linked resource and the HTML document.
-->

<!-- HTML boiler plate, and why is it important -->
 <!-- 
    The HTML boilerplate is a ready-made template for ur webpages.
    - boilerplates are like foundation of a house
    - it includes the basic structure and essential elements every html doc needs
    - it also saves u time and makes sure the basic structure is set up

    <!DOCTYPE html> -- specifes the version of html ur using
    <html lang="en"> -- wraps around all of ur content and can specify lang of ur page
    <head> contains imp metadata or machine readable info about the doc
    
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        - ur sites metadata, has details about things like character encoding, also how
        other website should preview ur link
    
    <title>text</title> -ur sites title, text on the browser tab
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="url/path" />
        - u typically link ur external stylesheets or css in the head using link

    <body> - this where all the content goes, what visitors actually see on ur webpage
 -->

<!-- What is UTF-8 character encoding, and why its needed -->
 <!-- 
    UTF-9, or UCS Transformation Format 8, is a standardized character encoder
    widely used on the web

    Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data
    > essentially all text on a webpage is a sequence of characters stored as one
    or more bytes
    - UTF-8 stores characters in the unico character set 
    (includes characters and symbols from all writing systems, languages)
    
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    By setting character encoding to ut8 it will ensure that the accident e (e with ') 
    is displayed correctly on the page.
