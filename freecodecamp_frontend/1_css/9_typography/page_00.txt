1) What Are the Fundamentals of Typography?

    Typography is basically the art of arranging text so that its not 
    only readable but also visually appealing and expressive. Think of it 
    as designing with words. The shapes, sizes, and arrangements of 
    letters all help communicate mood, hierarchy, and identity.

    Choosing the right type isn't just visual decoration. It can even 
    help evoke emotion, guide the reader's eyes, and express a brand's 
    personality.

    # Typefaces vs Fonts: Blueprints and building blocks
        A typeface is like a blueprint.
        It is the general design of a whole family of characters, numbers,
        and symbols.

        A font is one specific member of that family.
        For instance, a certain size, weight or style (italic, bold)

    eg: typface is times new roman,
        and fonts within it, times new roman bold, times new roman italic

    Each font variation changes its weight (how thick the strokes are), 
    style (whether it’s slanted like italics), and width (how stretched 
    or condensed it looks).
    
    2 important examples of typefaces are Serif and Sans Serif. The Serif 
    typeface has a classical style with small lines at the end of 
    caracters.
    Serif is usually used for printed materials, like books...

    Whilst Sans Serif is more modern looking, without those small lines.
    - its mostly used for digital design because they are easy to read 
    read on screen.

    Typefaces are like blueprints for fonts, but they can also be grouped
    if they share a similar design.
     Variations within the same font family typically include:
     - weight: 
     the thickness of characters, light, regular, bold, and black
     - style:
     the slant and orientation of characters like italic or oblique
     - width:
     the horizontal space occupied by characters, condensed and expanded

    There are more fundamental elements of typography..

    - Cap height: the height of uppercase letters.
    - X-height: how tall lowercase letters are (like the body of an “x”).
    - Ascenders: parts that stick above the x-height (like in “b” or “h”).
    - Descenders: parts that drop below the baseline (like in “y” or “g”).

    Understanding these parts helps designers align text precisely and balance its proportions.

    # Typography isn’t only about letters. It’s about the space between them:
        - Kerning adjusts space between specific pairs of letters for a 
        smoother look (for example, bringing A and V closer so they don’t 
        look awkwardly spaced).

        - Tracking adjusts the overall spacing across all letters in a 
        word or paragraph, making text look tighter or more open.

        - Leading (rhymes with “heading”) controls the vertical space 
        between lines — measured baseline to baseline. More leading means 
        more breathing room between lines.

    These subtle tweaks make text more readable and visually balanced.

    #Line Length and Readability...
    Even the width of your text block affects comfort:
    
    - If lines are too short, the reader’s eyes jump too often = tiring.
    - If lines are too long, the eyes lose their place — also tiring.

    The best line length feels natural, allowing smooth scanning without 
    mental effort.

    # Hierarchy and Emphasis

    Typography can guide attention just like visual cues in a painting.
    - Big fonts signal importance (like headlines).
    - Bold text adds emphasis.
    - Italics or underlining highlight key ideas.
    - Spacing and color contrast draw the eye to what matters most.

    Typography is more than choosing a “pretty font.” It’s a design 
    language that shapes how people experience information.

    Knowing how to manage typefaces, spacing, and hierarchy lets you 
    build designs that are not just readable — but memorable, emotionally 
    resonant, and true to your brand’s identity.

2) What are some best practices for working with typography in ur designs?

    Typography is the art and technique of arranging text type to 
    communicate effectively. It involves choosing fonts and formatting 
    text to make it readable, structured, and accessible.

    "Readability" is key. Choose clear, simple fonts so users can easily 
    engage with your content. Popular web fonts include Roboto, Open 
    Sans, Poppins, Lato, and Barlow. Make sure text is large enough and 
    lines aren’t too long — shorter lines are easier to read.

    "Hierarchy" helps users navigate content. Use font size to 
    distinguish headings, subheadings, and paragraphs. For example, main 
    headings should be the largest, followed by smaller subheadings, 
    guiding the reader visually through the structure.

    "Consistency" matters. Stick to two or three fonts across your design 
    to maintain visual cohesion and reinforce your brand. Overusing fonts 
    can confuse readers and slow down your website. Use whitespace to 
    balance text and improve readability.

    "Accessibility" ensures everyone can read your content. Follow the 
    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for sufficient contrast ratios, 
    allow font size adjustments, and avoid overly complex fonts. Ensure 
    your typography displays correctly on all screen sizes and devices.

    Typography is more than aesthetics — it’s a tool to enhance 
    engagement, readability, and user experience. Using these best 
    practices, you can create designs that are both beautiful and 
    functional.

3) What Are Font Families and How Do They Work?

    A font family is a group of fonts that share a common design, like 
    siblings with similar traits but different styles, weights, or widths.

    Example: Arial includes Arial Bold, Arial Italic, etc.

    > In CSS, you set the font family with the font-family property:
        #example {
            font-family: Arial;
        }

    > Fallback Fonts
    If the first font isn’t available, you can provide alternative fonts 
    in order of priority:
        #example {
            font-family: Arial, Lato;
        }
        The browser first tries each character for one font, and if its not there then it switches to backup font

    > Generic Font Families
    fonts browsers use if none of the specified fonts are found.
    This ensures that the text is readable atleast.

        serif – traditional, with small finishing strokes
        sans-serif – clean and modern, no finishing strokes
        monospace – every character takes the same width
        cursive – decorative, like handwriting
        fantasy – playful or ornamental
    
    example with general fallback....
        #example {
            font-family: Arial, Lato, sans-serif;
        }

    Good practices:
        - Always include a generic font family at the end.
        - Use web-safe fonts when possible — these are commonly installed 
        across devices.
        - Check how fallback fonts look across browsers; they may not match your original design perfectly.

    Takeaway: Using font-family strategically lets you control the look 
    of your text while keeping it readable, even if a user doesn’t have 
    your preferred font installed.

4) What Are Web Safe Fonts?

    Web-safe fonts are fonts that are very likely to be installed on most 
    computers and devices. Using them ensures your text is rendered 
    consistently across different operating systems and browsers.

    How do browsers handle fonts?
    - When a browser tries to display a font, it first looks for the font 
    on the user’s system.
    - If the font isn’t available, the browser falls back to a default 
    system font.
    - Fallback fonts may look very different, which can affect design and user experience.

    Why Web-Safe Fonts Matter?
    - They guarantee consistent appearance across devices.
    - They enhance readability and accessibility.
    - They can reduce page load time, since no external font files need 
    to be downloaded.

    Using Web-Safe Fonts
    - Use them as primary fonts for simplicity.
    - Or combine with custom fonts, providing a web-safe font as a 
    fallback.

    Eg of websafe fonts,
        - sans serif fonts  
            = arial, verdana, trebuchet ms
        - serif fonts   
            = times new roman, georgia

    So if you use web-safe fonts like these, your website will:
    - Look consistent on different devices
    - Be readable and accessible
    - Load faster, because these fonts are usually already installed

5) What Is the @font-face At-Rule, and How Does It Work?

    First, what is an At-Rule?
    - At-Rules in CSS are special statements that give instructions to 
    the browser.
    - eg: @media, @keyframes, and @font-face

    What does the @font-face do?
    - It lets u define custom fonts that are not necessarily installed
    on the users devices
    - It lets u specify, font name (font-family), font files (src) and  
    optional descriptions like weight, style, format, and technology.

    Example:
        @font-face {
            font-family: "MyCustomFont";
            src: url("path/to/font.woff2"),
                url("path/to/font.woff"),
                url("path/to/font.otf");
        }
    font-family – The name you’ll use in your CSS to apply the font. 
    Example:
        body {
            font-family: "MyCustomFont";
        }

    src – The list of font resources. The browser will try them in order 
    until it finds one that works.

    Some optional features,
        i) specifying format
        helps the browser understand the font type.
        eg:
                @font-face {
                    font-family: "MyCustomFont"; 
                    src: url("path/to/font.woff2") format("woff2"),
                        url("path/to/font.otf") format("opentype"),
                        url("path/to/font.woff") format("woff");
                }

            woff = web open font format
            woff2 = a more compressed version
            opentype = scalable font format with extra features

        ii) specifying technology
        optional hints about the font
        eg: tech(color-COLRv1).


    How does this all work?
    - browser downloads the font fles u specify in order and uses the 
    first one that works
    - if a font is missing a character, the browser may fall back to 
    another font in the src list.

    Why it matters?
    - Using @font-face allows for unique, branded typography beyond 
    web-safe fonts.
    - Gives control over how text looks on all devices
    - Supports multiple formats so fonts render correctly across browsers

    In short: @font-face is your tool to bring any font into your website 
    safely and reliably, even if users don’t have it installed.

6) How Do You Work with External Fonts Like Font Squirrel and Google 
    Fonts?

    external fonts are fonts not included in ur project; but one thats 
    hosted on a seperate server.

    - it allows use of custom fonts even if users dont have them installed
    - Popular sources: font squirrel, google fonts

    Note, using too many external fonts can slow down ur switches

    * google fonts:
    - free fonts designed for web projects
    - interface overview:
        - fonts section: browse, filter, preview text, adjust font size
        - noto fonts: supports 1000+ languages and 150+ writing systems
        - free icons for web projects
        - help/faq section: to learn about font best practices and liscece

    - using fonts:
        - preview ur text with the font
        - select the font -> click "get font"
        - choose download(local) or get embed code(external)

    - embedding in a project example:
    i) link element (html head)

    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@100;400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

    ii)  css example (roboto weights)

    .roboto-regular {
        font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
        font-weight: 400;
    }
    .roboto-bold {
        font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
        font-weight: 700;
    }
    .roboto-thin-italic {
        font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
        font-weight: 100;
        font-style: italic;
    }

    iii) @import option:

    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@100;400;700&display=swap');

    Note, Only include the font styles you need to reduce load time.


    Font Quirrel.
        - find and download free custom fonts

    steps to use:
     - search then select font then view specimens, test drive, glyphs.
     - go to webfont kit, then check liscence, susbet, format
     - click download @font-face kit then unzip then find
        - web fonts folder (font files)
        - html file (instructions)
        - license file
     - follow the html instructions, then include fonts with @font-face in css or host externally

    key points....
        - external fonts customize design but can affect performance
        - google fonts = easy embed
        - font squirrel = downloadable for local or external hosting
        - always choose only styles u need for efficiency

    eg of all roboto styles:

    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

    <p class="roboto-thin">roboto-thin</p>
    <p class="roboto-light">roboto-light</p>
    <p class="roboto-regular">roboto-regular</p>
    <p class="roboto-medium">roboto-medium</p>
    <p class="roboto-bold">roboto-bold</p>
    <p class="roboto-black">roboto-black</p>

    <p class="roboto-thin-italic">roboto-thin-italic</p>
    <p class="roboto-light-italic">roboto-light-italic</p>
    <p class="roboto-regular-italic">roboto-regular-italic</p>
    <p class="roboto-medium-italic">roboto-medium-italic</p>
    <p class="roboto-bold-italic">roboto-bold-italic</p>
    <p class="roboto-black-italic">roboto-black-italic</p>

7) What Is the text-shadow Property, and How Does It Work?

    Text shadows in css by default isnt applied to texts at all
    In order to add them, use the text-shadow property.

    syntax:
      text-shadow: [color] x-offset y-offset [blur-radius];

    - x offset (required): hotizontal distance of the shadow
    - y offset (required): vertical distance of the shadow
    - blur radius (optional):
    controls how soft or sharp the shadow appears (default = 0)
    - color (optional):
    any valid css color value (hex, rgb, hsl, etc...)

    basic example:

    <p> Hello, World!</p>

    css
    p {
        text-shadow: 3px 2px;
    }

    Shadow appears 3px right and 2px down from the text.

    # U can specify color after or before the offsets- both are valid

        /* Color after offset */
        p {
            text-shadow: 3px 2px #00ffc3;
        }

        /* Color before offset */
        p {
            text-shadow: #00ffc3 3px 2px;
        }
    The text now has a cyan-colored shadow.

    # Negative values move the shadow left (X) and up (Y):

    p {
        text-shadow: -3px -2px #00ffc3;
    }

    # adding blur radius:
        text-shadow: 3px 2px 3px #00ffc3;


    # You can stack multiple shadows using commas — they’ll layer front 
    to back (first = topmost).

    p {
        text-shadow: 
            3px 2px 3px #00ffc3, 
            -3px -2px 3px #0077ff, 
            5px 4px 3px #dee7e5;
    }
    Creates a multi-layered shadow effect with three colors.

    text-shadow enhances readability and adds visual depth.
    Format: color x y blur.
