1) What Are Pseudo-classes, and How Do They Work?

Pseudo-classes in CSS are special keywords that let you style elements
depending on their state or their position within a parent element.

- They are added to a selector with a colon (:) followed by the pseudo -
class name. This makes it possible to style elements in ways that respond
to user interaction or document structure.

eg)
the :active pseudo-class applies styles when an element is active. If a button is clicked, it can change color:

button:active {
background: greenyellow;
}

eg)
The :hover pseudo-class defines what happens when a user hovers over an element, such as removing an underline and
setting a crimson background on links:

a:hover {
text-decoration: none;
background: crimson;
}

eg) Pseudo-classes also let you target elements based on their position. Using :first-child, you can select the very
first child inside a parent. For example, given this HTML:

<div class="container">
    <p>first child</p>
    <p>second child</p>
    <p>third child</p>
    <p>last child</p>
</div>

You can select only the first <p> inside the container:

    .container p:first-child {
    background: lightcoral;
    padding: 0.4rem;
    }

    This would give the first paragraph a lightcoral background and padding. Similarly, :last-child targets the last
    element in a parent, so the last
<p> in that same container could be styled the same way:

    .container p:last-child {
    background: lightcoral;
    padding: 0.4rem;
    }


    eg)
    Pseudo-classes also help with user interactions beyond hovering or clicking. The :visited pseudo-class changes the
    appearance of links a user has already clicked:

    a:visited {
    color: purple;
    }

    eg)
    And the :disabled pseudo-class is useful for styling disabled form elements, such as making a button appear
    inactive:

    button:disabled {
    background-color: lightgray;
    }

    In addition to these examples, CSS provides many other pseudo-classes. Some
    of the most useful include :focus (applies when an input is focused),
    :first-of-type and :last-of-type (for targeting elements based on type
    rather than just child order), :nth-of-type (for more complex sequences),
    :enabled, :checked, :required, and even newer ones like :modal.

    Altogether, pseudo-classes give you powerful ways to style elements not
    just based on what they are, but also on how users interact with them and
    where they sit in the page structure. This makes websites feel more
    interactive, responsive, and user-friendly.

    2) What Are Examples of Element User Action Pseudo-classes?

    User feedback in web design is essential for improving user experience. It
    provides visual cues that indicate the state of interactive elements, like
    whether a link has been visited or a button is being clicked. CSS user action
    pseudo-classes let you implement this feedback without JavaScript.

    Key Pseudo-Classes:
    i) :hover = Triggered when a user hovers over an element (like a button or link).

    .btn:hover {
    background-color: darkgreen;
    color: white;
    cursor: pointer;
    }

    ii) :active – Applies styles when an element is being activated (clicked).

    iii) :focus – Applies styles when an element gains focus, usually via
    keyboard navigation or clicking into a form input. Important for
    accessibility. (eg: tab buttons)

    iv) :visited – Targets links the user has already visited.

    v) :checked – Styles form elements (checkboxes, radio buttons) when selected.

    Other Useful Pseudo-Classes:

    i) :focus-within – Styles a parent when it or any child element has focus.

    ii) :enabled / :disabled – Target form elements based on whether they are active or inactive.

    iii) :target – Styles an element targeted by a URL fragment (after #).

In short: pseudo-classes provide dynamic styling based on user actions, improving interactivity, clarity, and accessibility.
