..........Working with Colors in CSS..........

1) What is color theory in design??

Color theory refers to the study of how colors interact, relate, and 
influence perception. it explores color relationships, harmony, and
psychological effects.

3 classifications:
    i) primary: red, blue yellow
    Foundation colors from which all other colors derive
    ii) secondary: green, orange, purple
    Formed by mixing equal parts of 2 primary colors
    iii) tertiary, yello-green, blue-green, and blue-violet
    Made by combining primary with a neighbouring secondary color

Colors can be divided into warm and cool categories too..
- warm colors:
    red, orange, yellow that evokes comfort, energy, warmth
- cool colors:
    blue, green, purple that gives calmness, serenity, professionalism

Digitially, to show colors, designers use color models like RGB, HSV, and HSL, which define colors based on different properties and are essential for consistent reproduction across media.

A fundamental design tool is the color wheel, a circular diagram showing color relationships, it helps selecting color combos and building color schemes which are groups of colors used in design projects based on color theory principles.

main types of color schemes include:
    - analogues
    Using adjacent colors on the wheel. that creates a cohesive and soothing effect
    - complementary
    use colors that are opposite eachother. it provides high contrast and visual impact
    - triadic: uses three colors evenly spaced on the wheel
    It forms an equilateral traingle, and makes a vibrant balanced look
    - monochromatic: uses variations of a single color by adjusting 
    lightness, darkness, and saturation;
    evokes unity and harmony while maintaining contrast

Color contrast is cruicial for web accessibility, ensuring text and 
key elements are distinguishable, particularly for users with visual 
impairments.

--> tips for effective color use in web design:
    i. Develop a color scheme that reflects your brand.
    ii. Use colors to evoke emotions aligned with your goals.
    iii. Ensure adequate contrast for accessibility.
    iv. Use color to emphasize key elements like buttons.
    v. Apply colors consistently to build visual hierarchy.

color theory underpins effective design by combining color 
psychology, harmony, and accessibility to create visuals that engage 
users and enhance experiences.
