1)What are best practices for tables and accessibility?

Tables create visual associations between data and headers.
This is harder for screen reader users.
Web developers need to structure HTML for accessibility.

1 -Use the <caption> element to provide a title or description.
Helps users understand the table's purpose.
Place the <caption> element immediately after the opening <table> tag.
Screen readers announce the caption before reading content.

2 -Row and Column Headers
Headers are special cells at the start of rows or columns that describe the data.

Use the <th> (table header) element to define row or column headers.
<thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

 3 -Associating Data Cells with Headers (Scope Attribute)
Essential for screen readers to correctly interpret the table.

Use the scope attribute in <th> elements.

scope="col" for column headers.
scope="row" for row headers.

Explicitly indicating the scope ensures clarity even if screen readers can guess.

4 - Complex Tables (Multiple Headers)
If a header spans multiple cells, the scope applies to each cell individually.
Example:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">Pets</th>
      <th colspan="2">Dogs</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Nora</th>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Gino</th>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

5 - Flattening Complex Tables
Avoid complex tables with headers spanning multiple rows or columns.
Screen readers may not interpret them correctly.
Goal: Simplify the table structure for accessibility.
Make sure users can access all information, regardless of screen reader capabilities.

6 -Cell Width and Height
Avoid fixed values for cell width.
Use relative values like percentages.
Avoid defining cell height.
Allows users to adjust text size to fit their needs.

7- Table Width
Let the browser determine the table width whenever possible.
Reduces the need for horizontal scrolling.

2)Why Is It Important for Inputs to Have an Associated Label?

label on inputs make forms easier to use, ppl with disabilities mainly
- its imp for accessibility - bc screen readers help users know what an input is
- best is <label> element. a label is connected to input via id attribute

it helps with seo too
