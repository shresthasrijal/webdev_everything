accessibility is a cruicial accept of digital content

    best is to have manual testing with people with disabilities

    google lighthouse, a popular web metric checker that u can directly use
    within chrome devtools or online

    On chrome to use lighthouse, press f12, and switch to lighthouse tab
    and press analyze page button, this will get u a score

    the downside is it isnt good to check local websites if u use the web version

    - the ibm equal accesibility checker

        - in chrome webstore
         u can check the report as an excel or html file, via export xls button

        - use proper heading levels

        - use clear and descriptive text
        - each page a signle h1 element representing the main topic
