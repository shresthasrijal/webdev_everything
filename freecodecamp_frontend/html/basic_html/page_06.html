HTML Fundamentals

1) What are divs and when should you use them?

    - div is a content division element.
    - It is a beautiful being that can be anything you want it to be
    - The div can be given a height, width, and even a background color using css

    - We can also use div as a standalone that holds other content together
    eg: <div> 
        <h1> I am a heading</h1>
        <p> I am a paragrapjh</p>
    </div>
    - Just be aware that there could be better elemnts when to group elements together
    A section elemnt for example, if ur doing a naked div
        - This is because the section element has a semantic meaning, 
        Semantics are the meanings of words or phrases in a language
        HTML- a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too
    
2) What are ids and classes and when should you use them?

#    The "id" attribute
    - It adds a unique identifier to an HTML element
    eg: <h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
    - U can refernce the id name of "title" within css or js
    - css eg:
    #title{
        color: red;
    } 
    The # here tells the computer u want to target an id with that value
    - U cant repeat an id more than once, and they should be unique always
    - U also cant have spaces in id names
    Only letters, digits, underscores and dashes allowed

#    The "class" attribute
    In contrast to the ID attribute, the class attribute also adds an identifier to an
    element or multiple elements
    - it doesnt have to be unique, can be used multiple times, and can have spaces

    eg: <div  class="box"></div>
    Now if u want to add multiple classes to an element, u can do so by a space
    eg: <div class="box red"></div>

    -class eg:
    .box {
        height: 200px
        width:200 px
        border: 2px solid black;
    }
    here the "." is used to reference class names

# Classes are best used when u want to apply a set of styles to many elements
# But if u want to target a specific element its best to use an id


3) What are HTML entities, and what are some common examples?

    - An HTML entity, or character refernce, is a set of characters used to represent
    reserved characters in html
    eg: <p> THis is an <img/> element</p>
    In the eg, there is a img element inside paragraph element
    - We might think that the result would show THis is an <img/> element
    - But we get: This is an element

    This is happening bc when the HTML parser sees less than symbol followed by an html
    tag name it interprets it as an HTML element

    -To fix this issue use an HTML entity
    <p> THis is an &lt;img/&gt; element</p>
    &lt; == less than symbol
    &gt; == greater than symbol

    - These type of character refernces are known as named character references. 
    They start with an "&" sign and end with a ";" semicolon
    - With these, html parser wont confuse ur code to an actual html element


    Another type of entity refernce would be the decimal nuemeric refernce
    &#60;
    Another one is hexadecimal numeric reference
    &#x3C;

4) What is he role of the Script Element in HTML, and how can it be used to link
    to external javascript files?

    - The Script element
    It is used to embed executable code. Most developers will use this to execute JS code
   
    javaScript is used to add interactivity to ur webpages, common examples:
        - interactive games
        - image sliders
        - dynamic forms that validate user input in real time
    eg:
    <body>
        <script>
            alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp")
        </script>
    </body>

    You can technically write all of ur javascript code inside the script tags
    But it is considered best practice to create a sperate file and link it
    eg:
    <body>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
    - We dont usually write all of our js inside script tag, is for 
    seperation of concerns
    - This is a principle where you seperate ur program into distinct sections and
    have each section address a seperate concern. In this case we want to seperate
    our javascript code from our html. Usually Ui vs Function


5) What is the role of the meta tag, and how does it affect SEO?

    - SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a practice that optimizes web pages so
    they become more visible and rank higher on search engines
    - One way to improve SEO, is to provide a short description for the webpage using
    the meta element
    eg: <meta name="description" content="Discover expert tips and techniques here" />

    - this meta tag can not be seen on the website but it can be seen on google or other
    searches below the site links
    (it can give info about the page and help ppl decide to click)
    -It could help bring traffic to ur site

6) What is the role of the Open graph tags, and how do they affect SEO?

    -The open graph protocol enables u to control how ur websites content appears
    across various social media platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn

    - In a fb post or linkedin card,if u set up open graph properties, u can allow users
    to click and engage with ur content
    - These properties can be set through a collection of meta elements inside ur 
    HTML head section

    1: title property
    # <meta content="title text here" property="og:title" />
    here og: means the title u want to show on social media sites
    
    2: type property
    Here is an example of og type
    # <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
    - It is used to represent the type of content being shared on social media
    (can be artcile, website, videos, or music)

    3: The third important OG property would be the image, here is an example of
    sending the image for freecodecamp page
    # <meta property="og:image" 
    content = "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/something/smething/file.png" />
    
    - most social media sites will provide criterais to enusre that ur content 
    displays well on their site

    4: The url property
    This would be the most important og proeperty
    # <meta property="og:url" content="https://www.website.com" />

    And there are many more properties like:
    og:description, og:audio, og:video, og:locale

    However, type url,and title are the most important ones


    BUT but but, how do these open graph properties affect search engine optimization,
    when ur content is shared on social media, well crafted og properties can
    enhance the appearance for ur content in users feeds, this in turn can lead to
    high clickthrough rates which could increase traffic by signalling search engines
    that ur content is relevant
