1) What Are Replaced Elements, and What Are Some Examples?
    - A replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an external
    resource - rather than by css itself.
    eg: <img>, <iframe>, <video> elements
    - With replaced elements u can control the position or layout of an element but 
    ur CSS can not directly modify the content of that element
    (with iframe u can embedd external website 
    - common eg: to embedd maps or utube videos onto the page)

    There are other elements such as video and embedd, and some elements behave
    as replaced elements under specific circumstances
    eg: <input type="image" alt="Descriptive text goes here" src="example-image" />
        - but text and input are not replaced elements

2) What Are Common Ways to Optimize Media Assets?
    There are 3 tools to consider when using media such as images on ur webpages:
    - size
        When u build websites, ull often style images to display in a specifc size

        for eg, ull have a 650x480px image. And when preparing an image u want to scale
        and image to that resolution. But if u use a 1920x1080px image and scale it down,
        ure requiring ur users to download unnecessary data.

    - format
        This is the next thing to consider, in images the most common types are png and
        jpg. But these are no longer the most ideal formats for serving images unless u
        need to consider older browsers. 
        
        - Right now the best img formats are webp or avif.

    - compression
        Finally- u can run compression algos on ur images, it is used to reduce the size
        for files or data. 
        There are several optons like png crush to compress ur images locally or
        u can use online compression tools. 
        
        But its good to note, some file formats like JPEG are not lossless. Lossless means
        that the original data can be perfectly reconstructued  from the compressed data.
        
        - u should keep this in mind when selecting jpeg for image in ur website. 

3) What Are the Different Types of Image Licenses, and How Do They Work?
    Images are considered intellectual property, this means that they are protected
    via copyright regulations. Usually belonging to the creator.
    - Images are usually released as all rights reserved.
    Meaning that the creator or publisher hold all copyright for the image.

    This means that u can not use it in ur webpage unless u do 1 of 3 things:
        - Obtain written permission
        - Purchase a license
        - Incorporate in a way that falls under fair use
    (Fair use is tricky, u have to show ur use of img is both limited and transformitive)
    
    U have sveral types of liscence, but creative commons 0 = free to use,
    CC and BSD have rules

4) What Are SVGs, and When Should You Use Them?
    First we need to understand how images work, common img formates like png and jpg,
    are classified as raster formats. Basically means they are pixel based, with each
    pixel being one color. A downside of raster images is that they do not upscale well.

    An SVG is a different kind of image, an svg stands for a scalable vector graphic,
    a vector graphic tracks data based on paths and equations to plot points lines and 
    curves.
    This means u can scale an SVG to any size without affecting the quality.

    SVG have the added benefit of storing data in XML, this means u can use them directly,
    in ur code as raw HTML with the SVG element. - U can also edit colors and everything

    BUt, when would u use an SVG, a common usecase is for icons, custom bulletpoints,
    or to add icons to ur link. 
    - One of the most popular svg libraries "font awesome" uses SVG for their icons.
    And they scale properly for website icons too


5) What Are the Roles of the HTML Audio and Video Elements, and How Do They Work?
    <audio> and <video> element allows u to add sound and video to ur HTML
    
    <audio> supports popular formats like .mp3, .wav, .ogg
    <video> supports popular formats like .mp4, .ogg, and .webm

    eg: <audio src="audiofile.mp3"></audio>
    this will add it to ur page, but u cant see it
    
    - If u want to interact with it, u need to add the controls attribute
    eg: <audio src="audiofile.mp3" controls></audio>
        - it adds duration, volume, pausing, playback, etc
    
    There are more attributes that improve functionality of the audio
    - the loop attribute
        it is a boolean attribute that makes the audio replay continuosly 
        <audio src="audiofile.mp3" loop controls></audio>
    - the muted attribute
        this boolean attribute will start the audio in a muted stated
        <audio src="audiofile.mp3" muted loop controls></audio>
    
    When it comes to audio file types there are differences in which browser supports
    which audio type, to accomodate this, 
    -U can use source element inside the audio element and the browser will 
    select the first source that it understands

    <audio controls>
        <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
        <source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav" />
        <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
    </audio>

    Note: All of the audio attributes and sub elements also work with video
    - There is an extra attribute in video not in audio, say show a thumbnail or image
    when the video is downloading use the "poster" attribute
    <video src="video.mp4" poster="image_src"></video>

6) How Do You Embed Videos onto Your Page Using the iframe Element?

    <iframe> - this stands for inline frame. It is an inline element used to embed other
    HTML content directly within an HTML page.

    That HTML content could be a video, map, anothe html element, or even other webpages
    eg: 
    <iframe src="video-url" width="width-value" height="height-value" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    eg of utubure:
    <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zfz-_W70krE"
        title="Youtube video player"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope
        ; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>

    Note with utube, youtube.be is the share link, u have to have youtube.com/embed
    and youtube.com/watch is wrong too

    Correct format: https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID

    if u were to embed an html doc,
    then u will have to use "srcdoc" attribute instead of src
