Forms and Tables

1) How Do Forms, Labels, and Inputs Work in HTML?
    The form tab in html is used to collect user input. 
    It can be names or email addresses.

    It contains various elements such as labels, inputs,
    buttons, and more. Labels are associated with inputs
    to provide context, while inputs can be of different types
    (text, password, checkbox, etc.) to capture different kinds
    of data. 
    The form data can be submitted to a server for processing.

eg: <form action="url-goes-here">
        --- input elements here ---
    </form>
    The action attribute specifies where the form data
    should be sent when submitted. 

    To collect specific info like names and email addresses,
    u would use the input element

    eg:
    <form action="">
        <input type="text" />
    </form>

    Input elements are void elements, no closing tag is needed.
    The type attribute specifies the data type expected in input.

    To add an label, use the label element.
    eg:
    <form action="">
        <label>
            Name:
            <input type="text"/>
        </label>
    </form>


    Nesting input inside label makes it an implicit association,
    meaning clicking the label will focus the input.
    - the term implicit means something that is understood
    or inferred without needing to be explicitly stated or 
    defined with additional attributes or elements.

    To explicitly associate a label with an input,
    use the for attribute in label and id attribute in input.
    eg:
    <form action="">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name"/>
    </form>

    If u want to show additional hints or instructions
    for the user, you can use the placeholder attribute
    in the input element.
    eg:
    <form action="">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" 
        placeholder="Enter your name"/>
    </form>

2) What Are the Different Types of Buttons, 
and When Should You Use Them?
    The button element is used to perform a particular action
    when clicked. 
    eg: <button>Click Me</button>

    Other examples of using buttons include:
    - Submit button: Used to submit form data to a server.
      eg: <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    - Showing a popup or modal: 
      Used to display additional information or options.
      eg: <button type="button" onclick="showPopup()">
        Show Popup</button>
    - Toggling a side menu open or closed:
      Used to show or hide a side menu.
      eg: <button type="button" onclick="toggleMenu()">
        Toggle Menu</button>

    Note, the button element has a type attribute, it controls
    the behavior of the button when clicked.
    The type attribute can have values like:
        - button
        By default, the button element wont do anything when
        clicked. However u can add some js code to make the
        button interactive.
        - submit
        Another possible value for the type attribute is submit
        eg:
        <form action="submit-url">
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" 
            placeholder="Enter your name"/>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        - reset
        The reset type resets the form fields to their initial
        values when clicked.
        eg:
        <form action="submit-url">
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" 
            placeholder="Enter your name"/>
            <button type="reset">Reset</button>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>

        Note reset buttons are not commonly used in modern
        web design, as users typically expect to fill out forms
        without resetting them. However, they can be useful
        in certain situations, such as when users need to clear
        a form and start over. And multiple buttons in ur form
        can clutter the user interface, so it's important
        to use them judiciously and only when necessary.


        Another way to create button in HTMl is by using
        the input element with type attribute set to button,
        reset or submit.
        eg:
        <input type="button" value="Click Me" />
        The value attribute specifies the text displayed on 
        the button.

        Difference between using button element and input
        element with type attribute set to button:
        The input element with type button is a void element,
        meaning it doesn't have a closing tag, this also means
        it cannot contain any child elements or text content.
        
        Whilst the button element can contain text, images,
        or other HTML elements inside it, allowing for more
        complex button designs and styles and flexibility.
