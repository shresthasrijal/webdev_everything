<!-- Working with links

1) What Are the Different Target Attribute Types, and How Do They Work?
    - uve seen it on anchor elements or links
    The target attribute tells the browser where to open the URL for that anchor element
    - There are 4 important possible values for the target attribute:
        - _self
        This opens a link in the current browsing context
        (current tab or window)
        - _blank
        This opens a link in a new browsing context
        (typically a new tab, can be configured to be new window instead)
        - _parent
        This opens a link in the parent of the current context
        (say ur website has an iframe, _parent makes it change the parent webpage)
        - _top
        This opens a link in the top most browser context,
        (if multi layer iframe then, the top parent is changed to link)

    -There is a 5th type called
        _unfencedTop
        This is currently used for the experimental fence frame API

    If you do not set a target attribute, the link opens in the current window/tab


2) What Is the Difference Between Absolute and Relative Paths?
    A path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in a file system

    - In web dev, paths are developers link to resources like images, stylesheets,
        videos, audios, and other web pages

    There are 2 types of paths, absoulte and relative path:
    - absolute path:
    file://Users/user/desktop/code_folder/about.html
    -relative path:
    about.html

    Both are essential in specifying file locations within a file system

    But how do we decide which one of them use and when?
    - An absoulte path is a complete link to a resource, it starts from the root directroy
    and it includes every other directory and finally the file name and extension
    
    The absoulte path also includes the protocol, http:// or https:// or file:// and the
    domain name and then file name
    eg: "https://webpage-domain.com/filedirectroy/filename.extension"

    Now, relative path
    They specify the location of a file relative to the directroy of the current file.
    - it does not include protocol or domain name, making it shorter and flexible for
    internal links within the same website
    (u can use relative file path, if say 2 html files are in the same directory
    and u need to call one file from the other file)

    But the standard:
    Use absolute paths when linkning to a resource hosted on an external website.
    And use absolute paths when u need the link to a page or resource to work 
    consistently regardless of the document location within the site.

    Use relative paths when linking to resources within the same website
    Use it if u want to keep ur code cleaner and easier to maintain during development
    Use it during local testing to ensure links work without and internet connection

3) What Is the Difference Between Slashes, a Single Dot, and Double Dot in Path Syntax?

    there are various types of links:
    - /public/logo.png
    - ./script.js
    - ../style.css

    These are all file paths, there are 3 key syntaxes to know:
    1) THe slash, which can be a backslash or forward slash depending on 
    ur operating sys "/" or "\"
    2) It is a single dot "."
    3) a double dot ".."

    The slash is known as the "path separator". It is used to indicate a "break" in 
    the text between folders or file names

    namois-files: points to a directroy of that same name
    namois/files; points to a file in the namois directory

    a single dot means that the path is recognized as a relative path. 

    double dots are much more common to acess files outside the current working directory,
    for eg in a file tree:
    my-app/
        - nodemodules/
        - public/
            - favicon.ico
            - index.html
            - robots.txt
        - src/
            - index.css
            - index.js
        - .gitignore 
        - readme.md

    If ur public/index.html needed to load favicon.ico file, u would use a
    relative path a single dot to access the current directory: ./favicon.ico

    If ur public/index.html needed to load index.css, then u would use a
    relative path with double dot to navigate to parent my-app directory, then src
    and then the file:
        ../src/index.css

    #note: absolute paths always start with a slash "/"

4) What Are the Different Link States, and Why Are They Important?
 
    Link states, when u click a link on a webpage it turns purple, that is a link state
    - mainly bc clicking caused the link state to change

    There are five different link states:
    - :link (default)
    A link a user has not clicked,visited, interacted with yet
    This is the base starting state for all links, the other states build on top of it

    - :visited (visited)
    This state is applied when a user has already visited a page being linked to
    By default it turns purple but u can leverage ur css to turn it into any color.

    - :hover (hovering over)
    THis state applies when a user is hovering their cursor over a link, it provides
    extra attention to a link to ensure a user actually intends to click it

    - :focus (focused)
    This state applies when we focus on a link,
    when u press tab on a webapge and it goes to that element, if its the link then focus

    - :active (activated)
    This state are for links activated by the user, this means clicking and holding 
    on the link with the primary mouse button by left clicking in most cases, 
    this can be helpful in showing a user that the element they clicked on is interactive

    usually its l-v-h-a
