1. What is ARIA?
ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It's a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to improve accessibility for users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.

Purpose: Helps describe roles, states, and properties of UI elements that are not natively accessible.

Common ARIA attributes:

role: Defines the role of an element (e.g., button, navigation).

aria-label: Provides an accessible name when visible text isn’t enough.

aria-hidden="true": Hides content from screen readers.

Best practice: Use native HTML elements when possible (they’re accessible by default). Use ARIA only when necessary.


2. Working with Accessible Media Elements
This section covers how to make audio and video content accessible to everyone.

Captions & Subtitles:

Use <track> element with kind="captions" to provide text for video/audio.

Example:

html
Copy code
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
Transcripts:

Provide a full text transcript of audio/video content.

Helps users who are deaf or hard of hearing, and also improves SEO.

Audio descriptions:

Extra narration describing visual content.

Important for blind or low-vision users.
