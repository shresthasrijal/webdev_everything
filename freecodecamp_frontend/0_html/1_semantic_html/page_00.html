 Semantic HTML and why should you care about it?

1) Why Should You Care About Semantic HTML?
    Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language,
    HTML which is a language,  have their own semantic meaning too

    Html can be seen as a text doc, where we have image text, heading and formatting
    The semantic related to an element, refers to what special info that element conveys
    eg: <p> </p> refers to a paragraph or text

    Most elements have a semantic meaning, but one that doesnt is the <div> element
    Why is this important, 
    - Using propert semantic html, will ensure the best experience for users with
    assistive like improving ur search ranking this is referred to as SEO
    - Also using semantic elments can improve ur development experience
    eg: like instead of finding the <div> that u used as ur navigation bar, u can
        just find the <nav> experience and edit it instantly, and sutff like that

2) Why is it Important to Have Good Structural Hierarchy?
    The most important way to have structural hierarchy is via heading elements
    <h1> <h2> and so on. Much like a text document, u do not want to use a heading
    element in the incorrect order

    U usually want to have only 1 h1 element on a page, and it comes before all ur
    other content, h2 is always after h1, never before, as it is a sub heading
    - U shouldnt skip h1 to h3, but u can have multiple heading elements at the same 
    level (multiple h2 for example)

    It may be tempting to use a specific heading element over another bc of its styling
    like <h1> for large texts. Instead u should use the proper element required for 
    ur doc structure and then use css to achieve the styling u like.

    <article>
        <p> Here is some
            <div class="large-text">Large Text</div>
        </p>
    </article>

    Using the right styling and element for hierachy is important for accessibility,
    assistive sturctures like screen readers rely on the structure of a web page
    to determine how to pause and announce that webpage to the user

    Proper website structure is also important for SEO
    as search engines parse the content of ur webpage, and determine then where and where
    it should show up in results.
    - If ur structure is malformed, search engines may not be able to rank ur website
    properly in relecvant search results.

    If ur structure isnt right, the web browser may have to guess what ur trying to show
    and it may not be what u wanted to do in acutality


3) What Is the Difference Between Presentational and Semantic HTML?
    Presentational HTML focuses on the appearance and style of the content, in the early
    days of HTML developers would use elements like the center, big and font elements
    BUT in mordern web dev u shouldnt use these types of elements bc of their limitations,
    and negative impacts on accessibility and maintainability.
    
    - Most presentational html elements have been deprecated. There are better ways
    to get the same results

    eg: font element - used to set font size and color of the text
    <font size="5" color="blue">sample text</font>
    default value is 3, ranges from 1 to 7

    - Even though this works, u should rather set font size and color via css not this

    eg: center element-was used to center the content horizontally with in its container
    <center> The texdt is centered.
        <p>HTML is awesome</p>
    </center>

    eg: big element- this was use to make enclosed text, one level bigger than its
    surrounding

    Semantic HTML - the now recommended practice
    - It describes the content of the elements so its much easier to read, understand
    , and maintain.
    - Search engines can easily understand ur webpage when u use semantic html
    - Good for accessibility purposes, and the semantic info in elements describes
    what they are, and what they do


4) When Should You Use the Emphasis Element Over the Idiomatic Text Element?
- these elements are closesly related to the concepts of presentational and semantic
    html. The idiomatic element<i> was originally used for presentational purposes but
    now-a-days, its used for highlighting alternative voice or mood idiomatic terms from
    another language technical language or thoughts
    <p> sample text <i lang="fr">je ne sais pas</i> sample text </p>

    U can also use a similar semantic element called the emphasis element <em>
    - u should use this element, when there is requirement of special emphasis compared
    surrounding text
    - its limited to a few words as it can alter the meaning of a sentence
    <p>Never give up on <em>your</em> dreams</p>

    If u dont have any special meaning ur html and u need italic, just use css instead

5) When Should You Use the Strong Element Over the Bring Attention To Element?
    The bring to attention elemnt - <b>
    is used to highlight keywords in summaries or porduct names in reviews

    Browsers usually do that via bold text. This draws visual emphasis to the product
    
    <p> <b> Product A</b> is very good at one thing over all the others</p>

    But, if u just need to highlight importance of a text, u should use the strong
    element instead of the B element. 
    <strong> is a semantic html element that emphasizes text that is crucial or urgent.

    <p> <strong> Warning: </strong> this food contains peanut butter</p>
    

6) What Are Description Lists, and When Should You Use Them?
    Description Lists -perfect element for presenting terms and definitions in an 
    organized and easy-to-read format.
eg: <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
    </dl>

    But description lists arent limited to just terms and definitions,
    they are much more versatile than that
eg: <dl>
        <dt>Flour</dt>
        <dd>2 cups</dd>
        <dt>Surgar</dt>
        <dd>1/2 cup</dd>
    </dl>

    When u have data in a key-value format, where one acts as a label, the
    description list element is perfect.

7) How Do Block and Inline Quotes Work in HTML?
    In HTML quoted elements are used to distinguish quoted texts from surrounding 
    content, this gives the quoted texts a format that is easy to identify

    - U should use the block quotation element for representing a section quoted from 
    another source, its mainly used for extended quotations.

    if the quto of the text has an address, u can cite it with the cite attribute
    eg: <blockquote cite="valid_url">"Kanye West is a gay fish"</blockquote>
    - u have to write quotes explicitly
    - Note cite doesnt show the source to the user, it only works behind the scenes
    
    - U can add citation element, an element u can use to mark up the title
    of a referenced creative work like a book, article, song, film, etc
eg: <blockquote cite="valid_url">"Kanye West is a gay fish"</blockquote>
    <p>-- Matt Stone-<cite>South Park [TV Series]</cite></p>

    U should use block quotes like these for long quotations from other sources, 
    but sometimes u will only need to quote a few words within a larger paragraph

    For that use the inline quotation element, and it adds quotation around the text
    automatically for u
    <p> As sharu said, <q cite="valid_url">my name is khan</q></p>

    These cite attributes wont give any visual changes but it will give screen readers
    and search engines more info about the quote

8) How Do You Display Abbreviations and Acronyms in HTML?
    An abbreviation = a shortened form of a word.
    eg: Dr. is an abbreviation for a doctor

    An acronum is a word formed from the initial letters of a phrase, with each letter
    representing the first letter of a word in that phrase.
    eg: WHO - acronym for world health organizaion

    - If u need to display abbreviation in HTML, use the abbreviation element
    U should always explain their full meaning when using them for the first time, 
    then u can use the abbreviation element to hightlight them and provide more details

eg: <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is the foundation of the web</p>
    visually no difference, but it adds useful context behind the scenes

    If u want a user to see the whole name/meaning of acronym use the title attribute
    (optional)
eg: <p><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> is goated.</p>

    U dont have to do this for every abbriviation or acronym but it is recommended 
    to do so for those that are unclear and might need additional info.


9) How Do You Display Addresses in HTML?
    The contact address element is ued to represent contact info for a section
    on a webpage. The address element is versatile and can be used for business pages,
    author pages, personal sites and more. 

    When it comes to building out ur websites contact sections, you should use a 
    semantic address element over a generic element like a div

eg: <address>
        <h2> Company Name</h2>
        <p> 
            1234 Abc Street <br />
            Sprinfield, WA 62523 <br />
            United States
        </p>
        <p> Phone: <a href="tel +15555555555">+1 (555) 555-5555</a></p>
        <p> Email: <a href="mailto:contant@company.com">contant@company.com</a></p>
    </address>

    One of the downsides of mailto links is that users often percieve it as a spam:
    just keep in mind when u use it. 

10) How Do You Display Times and Dates in HTML?
    The time element is used to represent a specific moment and time

eg: <p>The reservations are for <time datetime="20:00">20:00</time></p>
    - This is imp as it helps with search engine results and helps the browser process
    date time info more effectively. The value for the datetime attribute must be a
    valid year, valid month, valid time, local date, global date, or valid duration.

eg: <p> The graduation is on <time datetime="2024-06-15T15:00"> June 15</time></p>
    Here date is in the ISO 8601 format, YYYY-MM-DD and the capital T
    is a sperator for the time

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS

11) How Do You Display Mathematical Equations and Chemical Formulas in HTML?
    The superscript element is used to display a piece of text as a super script.

    A super script is a symbol or letter printed above the normal line of text.
eg: <p>2<sup>2</sup> (2 squared) is 4.</p>
    <sup>-- to show to exponents

    Super script should only be used to typogrpahy, if u want a styled raised text,
    just use CSS buddy
    
    The subScript Element, to show symbols or letters below usual line
    <p> CO<sub>2</sub></p>

12) How Do You Represent Computer Code in HTML?
    - The inline code element is used to represent short snippets of code inside text.
    Common uses would be for technical artciles and documentation pages.

eg: <p> To set the color to bue in css, do this:
        <code> color: blue;</code>
    </p>

    The code element is used to represent a single line of code.

    - If u want to show multiple lines of code instead:
    Wrap ur code in a "Preformatted Text Element"
    - The preformatted text element is used to represent preformatted text
eg: <pre>
        <code>
            body {
                color: red;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>

    When using the <pre> element u need to be mindful of spacing, because it will 
    display exactly as written inside the HTML doc, so extra spaces = extra spaces in web

    
13) What Are the U, S, and Ruby Elements Used For, and How Do They Work?

#   The u elment aka unarticulated annotation element
    - it is used to represent inline text that has non-textual annotation applied.

    <p>
    You can use u element to highlight <u>incccorect</u> <u>sping</u> <u>isseues</u>
    </p>
    Note: its basically underline, but if u want underline text just use css
    - Use it only to indicate that text has non-textual annotation applied

    The S element or strikethrough element for short, is used to represent when text is
    no longer accurate or relevant.

    <p><s>Tomorrows hike meeting is at noon</s></p>
    <p>Due to unforseen weather conditions, hike is kil</p>

#   The s element should never be used to show changes to a document, more appropriate
    element would be the delete text element ad the insert text element. 

#   The ruby element
    - This represents small text shown above or below the main text. It is typically
    used to show the pronunciation of East Asian Characters.

    <ruby> 明日 <rp>(</rp> <rt>Ashita</rt><rp>)</rp> </ruby>
    - means tomorrow jic
