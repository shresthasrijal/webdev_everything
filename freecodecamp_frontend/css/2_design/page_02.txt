Common Design Tips

1) What Are Design Briefs and How Do Developers Work with Them?
    Definition:
    - A design brief is a document outlining the objectives, goals, and requirements of a project.
    - Acts as a roadmap to guide the design process and ensure the final product meets the client’s needs.

    Who writes it:
    - Usually created by the client as a working draft.
    - Sometimes written by the designer, then reviewed and approved by the client.

    Key elements of a design brief:
        - Project & Business Overview
            - Company details, mission, values, unique selling points (USPs), and products or services.
        - Goals & Objectives
            - Purpose of the project and desired outcomes.
            - Examples: Increase site traffic, boost monthly page visits by a certain percentage, improve user engagement.
        - Target Audience
            - Demographics, interests, needs, and pain points of the intended users.
        - Competitive Analysis
            - Overview of competitors and how the project will differentiate itself.
        - Project Scope
            - Deliverables: e.g., mockups, final designs, prototypes.
            - Timeline: Deadlines and milestones.
            - Budget: Constraints and cost estimates.
            - Importance of being specific to prevent scope creep and budget overruns.
        - Constraints
            - Realistic expectations on what can be achieved given time and budget limitations.

    Approval process:
        The brief should be reviewed and signed off by all stakeholders before work begins.

    Developer’s role in the design brief:
        - Interpret & Implement: Understand project requirements and translate designs into a functional product.
        - Core tasks: Writing code, testing, debugging, and ensuring compliance with the brief.
        - Teamwork: Often part of a multi-developer team, coordinated by a project manager.
        - Even if not involved in early design decisions, developers must understand the brief as it directly impacts their work.

    Why it matters:
        - Prevents misunderstandings between client, designers, and developers.
        - Helps keep projects on track, within budget, and aligned with goals.
